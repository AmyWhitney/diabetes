          <p class="bignumber">5 days</p>

<p>You can go to any <a href="/register-offices">register office</a> but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day. </p>

<p>If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.</p>

<p>Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.</p>
